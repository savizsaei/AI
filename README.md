ðŸ¤– AI Practice Repository

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks designed for practicing and testing fundamental Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) concepts. The goal is to provide a structured environment for experimentation, coding exercises, and evaluation of AI techniques.

ðŸ“‚ Repository Contents
1. Practice Notebook

File: practice.ipynb

Description:
A hands-on notebook for experimenting with core AI/ML workflows. Includes exercises on data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

2. AI Test Notebook

File: AI_test.ipynb

Description:
A test environment to validate AI models. Covers small-scale experiments for classification, regression, and potentially deep learning tasks. Useful for benchmarking implementations and debugging.
